## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

It was requested by Mr. Alecsi, a small solution for tests in Postman, where it was possible to handle entries in a MySQL database using the Node.js language, leaving me to decide which is the best way to be followed.

<br>

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

A simple and practical solution with as few requirements as possible, especially in terms of access to the database.

<br>

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Dependencies:
  - OnLine MySQL Database.

- Limitations:
  - As it is a simple test, there are no limitations.

<br>

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

As it is a very objective test, focusing on SQL commands, the solution developed in Node.js, despite being 100% functional, can be further improved in relation to the returns given to the operator.

<br>

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

<br>

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js 16.13.0 +
  * Command Line Tools
  * Windows: Visual Studio OR Visual Studio Code + Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu
  * Ubuntu / Linux Mint: sudo apt-get install build-essential
  * Fedora: sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
  * OpenSUSE: sudo zypper install --type pattern devel_basis


### Installing

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/dan5e3s6ares/testedanielalecsijean.git danielTest

# Change directory
cd danielTest

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
npm run main

```
## MySQL online free database for tests

Currently, this project uses an online MySQL database, with only 5MB of space, which I believe is necessary to carry out the required tests.
